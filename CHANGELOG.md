# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-19
### Added
- Migrated the Input Panel to a CSS-based component with orange focus state, auto-resize, and Shift+drop overlay borrowed from Claude Code Fusion.
- Introduced a reusable `modules/drag-drop-module` cluster (facade, handler, processor, message bridge) for webview drag-and-drop.
- Added `file-operations/file-operations-facade.ts` and the core `file-path-module` (cache, clipboard, platform handler) to service `grabFilePathFromDrop`.

### Changed
- Extended the home view message router to route new commands and rely on `FileOperationsFacade` instead of deprecated message providers.
- Restyled `session-view` input container classes to remove inline styles and align focus colors with the new design tokens.

### Build
- Release packaged as `codeai-hub-1.0.9.vsix` via `./scripts/build-release.sh 1.0.9`.

### Changed
- Rebuilt the home action bar into a dedicated section with a unified `37,37,40` background and consistent padding.
- Refactored the session layout so `DialogPanel` consumes remaining vertical space while TODO, Input, and Status panels keep 8px spacing and fixed stacking.
- Simplified session tab labels to provider abbreviations with compact multi-line rendering.
