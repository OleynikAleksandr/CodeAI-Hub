## [1.0.12] - 2025-10-19

## [1.0.11] - 2025-10-19

### Build
- Release packaged as `codeai-hub-1.0.11.vsix` via `./scripts/build-release.sh 1.0.11`.

## [1.0.10] - 2025-10-19

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-19
### Added
- Migrated the Input Panel to a CSS-based component with orange focus state, auto-resize, and Shift+drop overlay borrowed from Claude Code Fusion.
- Introduced a reusable `modules/drag-drop-module` cluster (facade, handler, processor, message bridge) for webview drag-and-drop.
- Added `file-operations/file-operations-facade.ts` and the core `file-path-module` (cache, clipboard, platform handler) to service `grabFilePathFromDrop`.

### Changed
- Extended the home view message router to route new commands and rely on `FileOperationsFacade` instead of deprecated message providers.

### Changed
- Rebuilt the home action bar into a dedicated section with a unified `37,37,40` background and consistent padding.
