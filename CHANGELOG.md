# Changelog

This project evolves quickly during active FLOW development. We keep the changelog intentionally short and treat the code + docs as the primary source of truth.

## [1.1.742] - 2026-03-18
### Changed
- Repository-wide duplication debt is back under control: `jscpd` now reports `1207` duplicated lines out of `447` scanned sources, or `2.8%`, which is below the enforced `3%` threshold.
- The duplication gate is now single-source: `check-architecture.sh`, `npm run check:dup`, and release packaging all run the same repo-wide duplication command instead of disagreeing about the scanned surface.
- The largest diagram-related clone clusters were collapsed into shared building blocks:
  - shared provider option dialog shell for Codex/Gemini settings
  - shared diagram stage scaffold for `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades`
  - shared relation editor shell for module/facade relation editing
  - shared dialog-segment meta helper across PM and UI surfaces

### Fixed
- Release builds no longer emit the recurring repository-wide duplication advisory that had been hovering around `4.17%` to `4.25%` in recent diagram releases.

## [1.1.741] - 2026-03-18
### Changed
- Project Manager diagram stages now expose an explicit `Artifacts | Source | Help` contract: `Artifacts` keeps the visual diagram primary, `Source` shows read-only canonical Markdown, and `Help` remains separate guidance.
- `Diagram Modules` and `Diagram Facades` reopen back into the visual diagram instead of silently replacing the right panel with raw `module-map.md` / `facade-map.md`.
- Both diagram panels are now diagram-first surfaces: the canvas renders before semantic editing controls, internal `artifact -> sidecar` path chrome is removed from the default UI, and `*.flow.json` stays hidden as a runtime-only sidecar.
- The shared React Flow shell now supports manual node repositioning in addition to optional `Auto-layout`, and those layout changes persist across reopen/resume without changing semantic Markdown DSL content.

### Added
- Regression coverage for the new diagram header/source contract and updated facade-shell chrome.

### Known Issues
- Dense diagrams can still require manual layout cleanup after the first automatic placement; this release makes that path available and persistent, but does not yet redesign the graph projection itself.

## [1.1.740] - 2026-03-18
### Fixed
- Diagram workflow contract delivery: `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` now inject their strict field-reference and merge-rules assets directly into the emitted prompt, so the provider sees the canonical DSL enum constraints before generating the first artifact.
- This closes the newly exposed post-launch failure where a session started correctly but produced a non-renderable `module-map.md` with invalid enum values such as `Kind: application`.

### Changed
- Added regression coverage for diagram-stage contract assembly, proving that both contracts now embed field-reference and merge-rules text into the final prompt payload.
- Synchronized `SystemArchitecture`, the audit plan, and the recovered `todo-plan` around the stricter diagram contract requirement: fresh stage success now means both `session` launch and immediate PM parseability of the first artifact.

### Known Issues
- This release fixed prompt-contract parseability but still left the user-facing surface unfinished; the follow-up `1.1.741` release moves the diagram itself back to the primary panel and adds `Source` as the explicit secondary debug view.

## [1.1.739] - 2026-03-18
### Fixed
- Core workflow-state recovery: `/workflow-state` now hydrates canonical workflow artifacts from disk on cold start, so `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` no longer stay silently blocked just because the current Core/watchers lifetime missed the original filesystem events.
- Diagram-stage gating now follows the agreed manual-transition contract: if `virtual-simulation.md` or `module-map.md` exists, the next toolbar step unlocks even when the upstream stage is currently marked `invalid` or `outdated`.

### Changed
- Added regression coverage for cold-start workflow-state hydration and for the case where an invalid upstream `virtual-simulation.md` must remain diagnostically invalid but still allow manual launch of `Diagram Modules`.
- Synchronized `SystemArchitecture`, the audit plan, and the recovered `todo-plan` around the corrected bootstrap contract: stage validation state and next-step start gating are now treated as separate concerns.

### Known Issues
- This release closes the three confirmed gating/bootstrap blockers. Live verification of the deeper runtime path `session:create -> session:created -> session:binding -> sendSessionMessage` remains open until the new VSIX is rechecked in the running UI.

## [1.1.738] - 2026-03-18
### Fixed
- Project Manager diagram-stage bootstrap: `Diagram Modules` and `Diagram Facades` no longer require the upstream workflow stage to be exactly `completed` before a fresh toolbar launch. If the canonical upstream artifact already exists and gating is open, the next-step session can now start.

### Changed
- Added behavioral regression coverage for diagram-stage bootstrap, verifying that artifact availability is sufficient for launch while blocked gating still rejects the start.
- Synchronized `Workflow_CLI`, `WorkflowSteps_Overview`, and `SystemArchitecture` around the corrected launch contract for `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades`.

### Known Issues
- This release fixes the first confirmed toolbar-bootstrap blocker. The broader audit of `session:create -> session:created -> session:binding -> sendSessionMessage` remains open until the full fresh-start path is revalidated in the running UI.

## [1.1.737] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Hardening coverage for the interactive diagram workflow: concurrent merge regression tests, continuity normalization guards for `diagram_modules` / `diagram_facades`, Markdown DSL BOM/CRLF parsing checks, serializer CRLF normalization checks, and targeted tree-node status coverage for diagram branches.

### Changed
- Project Manager visual shell now keeps the last ready diagram visible during background refresh instead of blanking the canvas on every poll; empty graphs expose an explicit placeholder, and auto-layout failures surface through the shared save-status indicator.
- Workflow tree child nodes under `Diagram Modules` and `Diagram Facades` now mirror the real stage status (`active`, `outdated`, `blocked`) and tooltip copy instead of always rendering as active children.
- Markdown DSL normalization is stricter and more fault-tolerant: parser input accepts UTF-8 BOM + CRLF files, while serializer output normalizes multiline text blocks back to canonical LF-based Markdown.

### Known Issues
- Starting a fresh toolbar session for `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` remains a deferred blocker outside this release scope; this release hardens parsing, semantic merge safety, and PM workflow visualization for already-existing diagram artifacts.

## [1.1.736] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- `Diagram Facades` semantic editing: Project Manager now exposes facade create/update/delete controls plus methods, ports, and facade relation editing directly on top of the visual shell.
- Local facade patch pipeline and facade relation patch pipeline now exist as explicit client-side domain transforms, giving the UI deterministic semantic updates before serialization back to `facade-map.md`.

### Changed
- Semantic facade edits now autosave into canonical `facade-map.md`, while `facade-map.flow.json` continues to store only layout/view state.
- Local edits preserve provenance by converting modified agent-owned facades and relations from `origin: agent` to `origin: merged`.
- The PM session now keeps a facade-specific patch queue and reapplies it over incoming facade-map refreshes, surfacing preserved-edit conflict warnings instead of discarding local semantic changes immediately.

### Known Issues
- Fresh toolbar bootstrap for `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` is still outside this release scope, so repeated-agent manual verification remains limited to workspaces where the diagram artifacts already exist.

## [1.1.733] - 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- Core runtime packaging: `build-core.sh` now ships `packages/agents/diagram-modules-agent/assets/` and `packages/agents/diagram-facades-agent/assets/` into the installed core runtime, so release builds can resolve the new Markdown DSL diagram contracts instead of missing the prompt/template assets.
- Template sync: startup cleanup now removes stale home-cache diagram templates `modules-diagram-prompt.md`, `modules-diagram-template.mmd`, `facades-graph-prompt.md`, and `facades-graph-template.mmd`.

### Changed
- Corrective validation target for this release is the real installed workflow surface: `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` must start from the toolbar using Markdown DSL assets, while local `~/.codeai-hub/templates` must no longer expose the removed Mermaid diagram files.

## [1.1.734] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Project Manager visual shell: `Diagram Modules` and `Diagram Facades` now render canonical Markdown DSL artifacts through a read-only React Flow canvas with ELK first-layout and an `Auto-layout` action.
- Flow sidecar persistence: `module-map.flow.json` and `facade-map.flow.json` are now loaded and saved from the PM side so layout survives reopen/resume without semantic writes into the canonical `.md`.

### Changed
- Diagram panels no longer default to raw Markdown-only rendering once `module-map.md` / `facade-map.md` exist; the primary user-facing surface is now the visual shell, while `.md` remains the semantic SSOT.
- Browser bundle compatibility: the diagram DSL parser path now has a browser-safe revision fallback, allowing PM/UI to parse canonical diagram artifacts without bundling `node:crypto`.
- Validation target for this release moves from contract alignment to visible diagram inspection: render `module-map.md`, render `facade-map.md`, use `Auto-layout`, persist `*.flow.json`, and verify layout restoration after reopen.

### Known Issues
- Starting a fresh toolbar session for `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` remains a deferred blocker outside this release scope; this release focuses on visualizing and persisting already-created diagram artifacts.

## [1.1.735] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- `Diagram Modules` semantic editing: Project Manager now exposes module create/update/delete controls and relation create/update/delete controls on top of the visual shell.
- Local module patch pipeline and relation patch pipeline now exist as explicit client-side domain transforms, giving the UI deterministic semantic updates before serialization back to `module-map.md`.

### Changed
- Semantic edits now autosave into canonical `module-map.md`, while `module-map.flow.json` continues to store only layout/view state.
- Local edits preserve provenance by converting modified agent-owned module entities and relations from `origin: agent` to `origin: merged`.
- The PM session now keeps a local patch queue and reapplies it over incoming module-map refreshes, surfacing conflict warnings instead of discarding local semantic changes immediately.

### Known Issues
- Fresh toolbar bootstrap for `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` is still outside this release scope, so repeated-agent manual verification remains limited to workspaces where the diagram artifacts already exist.

## [1.1.732] - 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- Project Manager: toolbar start, gating, artifact availability, tree labels, and panel/help copy for `Diagram Modules` / `Diagram Facades` now follow `module-map.md` and `facade-map.md` instead of the removed Mermaid `.mmd` files.

### Changed
- UI/PM contract: the active diagram workflow surface no longer exposes `modules-diagram.mmd` or `facades-graph.mmd` as user-facing canonical artifacts.
- Validation target for this release shifts from runtime foundation only to an actual PM smoke: stage launch from the top toolbar and opening canonical `.md` artifacts from the tree.

## [1.1.731] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Core diagram DSL foundation: strict Markdown parsers/serializers for `module-map.md` and `facade-map.md`, revision metadata helpers, and baseline diff/change-summary services for repeated agent runs.
- Agent packages: dedicated asset packs for both diagram workflow steps (`prompt`, `template`, `field-reference`, `merge-rules`) now live under `packages/agents/diagram-modules-agent/assets/` and `packages/agents/diagram-facades-agent/assets/`.

### Changed
- Workflow runtime: canonical diagram artifacts are now `module-map.md` / `facade-map.md` plus auxiliary `*.flow.json` and `*.agent-baseline.md`; legacy Mermaid `.mmd` files are no longer part of the active workflow contract.
- Workflow prompts: runtime now assembles diagram prompt packs from agent-owned assets and injects generated `Change Summary` blocks instead of relying on legacy bundled Mermaid templates.
- Docs/SSOT: synchronized `WorkflowSteps_Overview.md`, `Workflow_CLI.md`, and `SystemArchitecture.md` so Diagram Modules / Facades explicitly describe the Markdown DSL triplet and the non-semantic role of `*.flow.json`.

## [1.1.730] - 2026-03-15
### Fixed
- Core continuity arbitration: flow-node/document-node rollover is now deferred to the post-turn boundary, so a low remaining-context `token_usage` snapshot can no longer preempt an active user one-shot turn before `turn_completed`.

### Changed
- Tests: added regression coverage for both provider event orders, guarding `Gemini` (`token_usage -> turn_completed`) and `Claude/Codex` (`turn_completed -> token_usage`) plus cache reset between outbound turns.
- Docs/SSOT: synchronized the continuity contract so `token_usage` acts as post-turn arbitration input, trailing usage can complete pending decisions, and cached usage from a previous turn cannot leak into the next one.
- Validation: manual `Gemini` document-node smoke on March 15, 2026 confirmed that the active one-shot turn in `v1.1.730` now completes before continuity handoff/bootstrap starts.

## [1.1.729] - 2026-03-15
### Fixed
- Gemini dialog history: `GeminiMessageProcessor` now flushes each assistant segment on `finished`, and `GeminiSessionManager` suppresses the old final aggregate `assistant` block when segmented replies were already emitted through `dialog_message`.

### Changed
- Tests: added regression coverage for both Gemini paths: segmented `content -> finished` delivery without duplicate final assistant output and fallback aggregate delivery when a turn ends without a `finished` segment flush.
- Docs/SSOT: synchronized the architecture invariant that provider normalization layers must preserve real assistant segment boundaries instead of collapsing them into a single post-turn blob.

## [1.1.728] - 2026-03-15
### Fixed
- Core transport: `WebSocketManager` now caches canonical `usage_limits` stream-events and replays them after websocket connect and workspace-scope changes, so `Codex` usage limits survive late `Project Manager` / `Session UI` attach instead of disappearing after the first live emission.

### Changed
- Tests: replaced the previous source-level `WebSocketManager` guard with a live websocket regression that verifies out-of-scope `usage_limits` are filtered live but replay correctly after scope switch with `providerScopeKey` preserved.
- Docs/SSOT: synchronized the architecture invariant that stateful session signals such as `token_usage` and `usage_limits` must have replay-safe delivery across scope rebinds.

## [1.1.727] - 2026-03-14
### Added
- Core: introduced a universal provider usage-limits module in `packages/core`, with shared types/cache/facade, provider-specific readers/normalizers, and a canonical `providerScopeKey` contract for `Claude`, `Codex`, and `Gemini`.

### Changed
- Claude, Codex, and Gemini now emit usage limits through the same shared pipeline `reader -> normalizer -> shared snapshot -> compat stream payload`; live provider surfaces are primary, while provider-specific fallback paths remain secondary.
- Codex usage limits now prefer runtime payloads and `app-server account/rateLimits/read`; rollout JSONL is retained only as fallback rather than the main source.
- Session UI and Project Manager now cache/fan-out usage limits by `providerScopeKey`, and `Session ID bar` renders provider-aware labels from the shared snapshot instead of hardcoded `session/weekly`.

### Fixed
- Usage-limits refreshes now expose source-aware diagnostics (`cache_hit`, `fresh_read`, `fallback_cached`, `unavailable`), making fallback/debug analysis explicit in the shared facade and Codex runtime logs.

## [1.1.726] - 2026-03-14
### Fixed
- Codex runtime: saved `providers.codex.defaultModel` from `~/.codeai-hub/settings/settings.json` now wins over stale `CODEX_DEFAULT_MODEL` in long-lived core/provider processes, so a user-selected `gpt-5.4` no longer silently starts new turns as `gpt-5.3-codex`.

### Changed
- Tests: added regression guards in both core config and Codex SDK manager to lock the priority order `settings snapshot -> env fallback -> hardcoded/workspace fallback` for Codex default model resolution.

## [1.1.725] - 2026-03-14
### Changed
- Documentation lifecycle: introduced `doc/SolidWorks-WorkFlow/Plans/` as the only place for pre-implementation planning docs before `doc/TODO/todo-plan.md`; implemented SSOT remains only in `System/`, `Clusters/`, `Modules/`, and `Contracts/`.
- Agent instructions governance: `AGENTS.md` is now the sole git-tracked instruction source, while local `GEMINI.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` are reduced to redirect notes outside repository tracking.

## [1.1.724] - 2026-03-13
### Changed
- Description workflow: removed the last product-visible legacy `description` architecture tails from PM/UI, core artifact routing, bundled fallback schemas, and active SSOT docs; the release now presents only the canonical `questionnaire.md` -> `Final_Description.md` flow.

### Fixed
- Project Manager: `questionnaire.md` no longer exposes the old manual `↻ Restart attempt` control, and compat `draftPath` no longer leaks the label `description.md` into tree/main-area routing.
- Core: obsolete `/api/v1/orchestrator/idea-artifact` transport and the remaining restart-era artifact bridge semantics are removed; active persistence stays on `/api/v1/orchestrator/artifact-upsert`.
- Validation: added final regression guards for Description cleanup invariants and revalidated the cleanup contour with targeted core/webview builds and tests.

## [1.1.723] - 2026-03-13
### Changed
- Mainline release verification: the primary `main` branch was hard-synchronized with baseline line `v1.1.722`, so subsequent work and the release cycle now proceed from the verified response-mode stable baseline.

### Fixed
- Codex runtime: the baseline fix for response-mode session promotion (`Debug/Raw` / `Hybrid`) is now available directly from the primary `main`, without depending on a separate baseline worktree.

## [1.1.722] - 2026-03-13
### Fixed
- Codex runtime: preserved response-mode state across `temp session id -> real thread id` promotion, so `Debug/Raw` and `Hybrid` no longer fall back to the default structured-output config after `thread.started`.
- Codex dialog history: ordinary text replies from `gpt-5.4` in `Debug/Raw` once again reach downstream `assistant` persistence instead of disappearing after the provider rollout is promoted to the real thread id.

### Changed
- Tests: added a regression guard for the session-promotion path in `StructuredOutputStreamController`, covering both `Hybrid` and `Debug/Raw` passthrough behavior.

## [1.1.721] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- General Settings: a new dedicated `Response Mode` card for Codex with `Strict`, `Hybrid`, and `Debug/Raw`, kept separate from `Core Controls`.

### Changed
- Codex runtime now reads `general.responsePolicy` from the persisted settings snapshot; baseline workflow sessions default to `Hybrid`.
- `Strict` mode exposes editable schema/instruction text, while ordinary turns in `Hybrid` and `Debug/Raw` no longer inherit the baseline default JSON-only shaping automatically.
- Commentary suppression in the Codex messaging path is now response-policy-aware instead of unconditional.

### Fixed
- Codex SDK diagnostics preserve historical `sdk-codex-*.jsonl` content across `resume` on the same `thread_id`.

## [1.1.720] - 2026-03-12
### Changed
- Codex baseline settings/UI/runtime replace the general-purpose model `gpt-5.2` with `gpt-5.4`, while keeping `gpt-5.3-codex` as the dedicated coding model.
- Codex settings snapshots now persist only two user-facing model keys in `reasoningByModel`: `gpt-5.3-codex` and `gpt-5.4`.
- Stable baseline release rebuilt from the pre-`gpt-5.4` workflow line, avoiding later PM workflow-state/hydration refactors while updating only the Codex model selection surface.

## [1.1.711] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- Project Manager: a watchdog retry was added for cold-open history, so a stalled first `dialog:history` request (`cursor=0`) is automatically reset and retried through a forced route without user intervention.
- Project Manager: fixed an intermittent `No messages yet` case on workspace open where history appeared only after a second click on the session/stage in the left tree.

### Changed
- Tests: `dialog-session-snapshot-replay.test.ts` was expanded with watchdog invariant coverage (`pending timeout -> forced retry`).

## [1.1.710] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- Project Manager: fixed the first dialog-mode open race, so `dialog:history:result` is no longer lost between `dialog:list:result` and the session identity update.
- Project Manager: on cold-open workspace, stage dialog history (JSONL) now hydrates immediately without requiring a second click on `Virtual Simulation` or another workflow step.

### Changed
- Tests: added a `dialog-session-snapshot-replay.test.ts` guard for the order `bind sessionRef -> requestDialogHistory`.

## [1.1.709] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- Project Manager: fixed workflow navigation desync between the Toolbar, the left tree (stage/session/artifact), and auto-select; the active step is now synchronized through a single `activeStage` route.
- Project Manager: removed stage-specific exceptions (`skipSession`) from stage activation semantics, so selecting a step now consistently opens the aligned dialog session.

### Changed
- Project Manager: the right-side header was unified for all workflow steps (`<Step Name> + Artifacts/Help`), and `Artifacts/Help` now works across steps.
- Project Manager: added help panels for non-description stages (`Virtual Simulation`, `Diagram Modules`, `Diagram Facades`).
- Tests: added a `workflow-navigation.test.ts` guard to prevent regressions in stage-selection synchronization.

## [1.1.708] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- Session UI: token usage now hydrates correctly for dialog-mode sessions resumed from continuity (fixes Codex showing `0 tokens / 100%`).

## [1.1.707] - 2026-03-05
### Changed
- Rebuild of the stable workflow baseline from `v1.1.706` as the new main release line (no workflow approval markers).

## [1.1.706] - 2026-03-01
### Changed
- Virtual Simulation is now prompt-only (no artifact template shipped); the agent writes `virtual-simulation.md` from `Final_Description.md`.

### Fixed
- Workflow: aligned Virtual Simulation prompt-only status and gating checks for downstream stages.

## [1.1.701] - 2026-02-28
### Changed
- Description runtime/core: removed reviewer auto-runtime branch and fixed description session persistence to collector-only mode for active flow.
- Project Manager UI: removed reviewer auto-focus/visibility branches from runtime session view and workspace-tree resume paths for `description`.
- Workflow templates: `description` bundle now uses only single-session collector wording; reviewer terminology removed from `description-collector-prompt.md`.

### Fixed
- Workspace activate/runtime resume: reviewer session slots are ignored for active delivery, preventing accidental reopen into legacy reviewer path.
- Template sync: legacy files `~/.codeai-hub/templates/description/reviewer-prompt.md` and `reviewer-template.md` are removed during sync.

## [1.1.696] - 2026-02-27
### Changed
- Workflow templates: simplified the Description questionnaire from 16 to 10 sections with plain-language names and inline examples for non-programmers.
- Workflow templates: aligned `description-template.md`, `description-collector-prompt.md`, `reviewer-prompt.md`, and `reviewer-template.md` with the new questionnaire structure.
- Reviewer Agent prompt: removed artificial 3-question limit; agent now discusses module/cluster composition as a first approximation.
- Description Agent prompt: when `modules_draft` is empty, agent proposes its own decomposition based on described scenarios and capabilities.
- Code: simplified `buildDefaults()` in `description-questionnaire-utils.ts` to only set `meta.title`; removed dead `formatDate()` and `resolveAuthorName()`.

### Added
- Workflow docs: `WorkflowSteps_Overview.md` — SSOT for all six workflow steps (Description → Virtual Simulation → Diagram Modules → Diagram Facades → Module Specifications → TODO Plan), including philosophy, artifacts, feedback loop, and adaptive templates concept.
- Workflow docs: `QuestionnaireTemplate_Draft.md` — intermediate draft used during the questionnaire redesign discussion.
- Docs index: added Workflow Overview section linking to `WorkflowSteps_Overview.md`.

## [1.1.695] - 2026-02-27
### Changed
- Project Manager: refactored duplicated stage artifact panel state rendering into shared components (`StageArtifactStateView`, `StageArtifactPendingLayout`) to keep duplication checks under the pre-push threshold.

### Fixed
- Release pipeline: `pre-push` duplication gate now passes again after the panel deduplication (`jscpd` back under 3%).

## [1.1.694] - 2026-02-27
### Fixed
- Project Manager: toolbar stage highlight is now workspace-scoped, so switching workspaces always reflects that workspace's last active step (`Description`, `Virtual Simulation`, `Diagram Modules`, or `Diagram Facades`).
- Project Manager: dialog open resume now checks runtime session presence in `workspace:snapshot` and triggers `session:create` when the dialog session is missing after restart.
- Virtual Simulation cold-start recovery: stale running lock and reset `total` timer are normalized/restored from snapshot + persisted timer state.

## [1.1.691] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Project Manager: when opening a stage dialog after Core restart and `dialog:list` has no `latestSessionId`, the UI now triggers `session:create` resume so workspace snapshots include the stage session again.
- Virtual Simulation: reopen after restart no longer remains stuck in default `running` lock while waiting for user input.
- Session timers: `total` restores after restart because the resumed stage session receives `taskTimer.totalSeconds` via `workspace:snapshot`.

## [1.1.690] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Project Manager: layout-level `workspace-scope-sync` now stores incoming `workspace:snapshot` payloads in `workspaceSnapshotStore` independently from runtime session view mount timing.
- Project Manager: Virtual Simulation no longer gets stuck with `Agent is working...` on late tab open after reload when the turn is already idle and waiting for user input.
- Session UI: `total` timer is restored on late mount because the latest snapshot is retained even when `workspace:snapshot` arrived before the tab subscribed.

## [1.1.689] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Project Manager: on runtime hydrate, the UI now reapplies the latest stored `workspace:snapshot` from `workspaceSnapshotStore`, preventing stale default `running` lock when snapshot arrives before `core:state`.
- Project Manager: Virtual Simulation restart/reopen path now keeps input unlocked and task timer state aligned with the latest snapshot after reconnect/reload.

## [1.1.688] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Core: cold-start recovery now normalizes stale `running` runtime sessions to `idle` on workspace selection when turn completion is already known and no bootstrap continuity lock is active.
- Core: persisted task timer totals are restored even when runtime sessions hydrate before the first `workspace select` call.
- Docs (SSOT): synchronized input lock and task timer contracts for the `Virtual Simulation` cold-start recovery rules.

## [1.1.687] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Project Manager: Session EmptyState no longer tells users to start from “buttons above”; it now explains the actual Description flow (`Artifacts` questionnaire → `Submit questionnaire` → provider picker).
- Project Manager: Description questionnaire CTA labels are now English (`Submit questionnaire`, `Close`) to match PM UI terminology.
- Project Manager: stage panel “Fix with agent” callbacks are type-aligned with `WorkflowStepStartService`, restoring green `npm run typecheck:webview`.

## [1.1.685] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Project Manager: false "Creating session…" spinner no longer appears when a stale dialog intent is restored from `localStorage` (e.g. on the Description tab in a fresh workspace). The pending indicator is now driven exclusively by the `pendingSessionCreate` flag (`emptyStatePending`), not by the mere presence of a dialog intent.

## [1.1.684] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Project Manager: all side-effects for gated toolbar buttons (Virtual Simulation, Diagram Modules, Diagram Facades) — `setActiveTool`, `setPendingSessionCreate`, `dispatchStageActivated`, `pm:dialog:open` — are now deferred until the async gating check passes. Clicking these buttons when the upstream artifact is missing produces zero UI changes.

## [1.1.683] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- Project Manager: new **Diagram Modules** workflow step — toolbar click launches an agent session that produces `modules-diagram.mmd`; artifact panel with mermaid validation (`%% Modules Diagram` header + `subgraph`) and "Fix with agent" recovery.
- Project Manager: new **Diagram Facades** workflow step — toolbar click launches an agent session that produces `facades-graph.mmd`; artifact panel with mermaid validation (`%% Facades Graph` header + edge syntax) and "Fix with agent" recovery.
- Project Manager: artifact availability polling hooks for both diagram stages (10 s interval, `maxBytes: "1"` probe).
- Project Manager: Workspace tree branch nodes for Diagram Modules / Facades (session child + artifact child), with gated progression (Diagram Modules requires VS done; Diagram Facades requires Diagram Modules done).
- Project Manager: table-driven toolbar handler (`DIAGRAM_STAGE_MAP`) for diagram clicks; `renderStagePanel()` helper eliminates duplicate workspace-check pattern in `main-area.tsx`.

## [1.1.681] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- Implementation of Diagram Modules & Diagram Facades workflow steps (code only; see `1.1.682` for the doc-synced release).

## [1.1.680] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- Project Manager: every click that says "I want stage X" (toolbar buttons, tree parent labels, tree child nodes) now syncs both artifact and session panels together via `resolveStageSyncPayload()` and the `pm:stage:activated` event.
- Project Manager: auto-select the latest workflow step (Virtual Simulation or Description) when opening a workspace.

### Fixed
- Project Manager: clear stale artifact when the VS session has no artifact file yet.

## [1.1.676] - 2026-02-26
### Changed
- Core: task timer storage is now per-workspace (stored in `<workspaceRoot>/.codeai-hub/state/task-timers.json`); legacy global file is cleaned up on startup.

## [1.1.675] - 2026-02-25
### Fixed
- Project Manager: remove the confusing Back button from the artifact viewer.

## [1.1.674] - 2026-02-25
### Fixed
- Project Manager: show `virtual-simulation.md` in the Workspace tree only after the artifact exists (avoids 404 when clicking).

## [1.1.673] - 2026-02-25
### Fixed
- Project Manager: Virtual Simulation reuses the provider selected for Description (prevents accidental provider switches).
- Session UI: workflow tabs use stage labels for non-description stages (e.g., `Virtual Simulation`) instead of showing `Reviewer`.
- Project Manager: Workspace tree now shows the `virtual-simulation.md` artifact as a child node under Virtual Simulation.

## [1.1.672] - 2026-02-25
### Fixed
- Project Manager: Virtual Simulation now immediately switches the Sessions panel into a pending state and auto-opens the stage dialog once it becomes available.
- Project Manager: Workspace tree shows the Virtual Simulation session (collapsible stage node with a session child).

## [1.1.671] - 2026-02-25
### Fixed
- Project Manager: Virtual Simulation toolbar now opens the stage session (and reveals the hint panel) instead of acting like a dead click.
- Project Manager: bridge config derives missing `httpUrl` from `wsUrl` (prevents workflow API calls from silently failing).

## [1.1.670] - 2026-02-25
### Added
- Workflow: new `Virtual Simulation` step with bundled prompt+template (file-first from `Final_Description.md`).
- Project Manager: start Virtual Simulation from the toolbar, show a hint panel until the artifact exists, and offer “Fix with agent” when validation fails.

### Changed
- Workflow state: record watcher events and compute deterministic gating + `OUTDATED` propagation.

## [1.1.669] - 2026-02-24
### Fixed
- Reviewer sessions: Stop → Play no longer resets task timer total (BUG-2026-02-24-04).

## [1.1.668] - 2026-02-24
### Fixed
- Project Manager (one-shot Description): after ↻ Restart attempt, auto-focus the newly created session (no manual click in the tree) (BUG-2026-02-24-03).

## [1.1.667] - 2026-02-24
### Changed
- Rebuild of `1.1.666` to avoid the `666` version number; no functional differences.

## [1.1.666] - 2026-02-24
### Changed
- One-shot Description: ↻ Restart attempt confirmation now uses an inline Apply/Cancel bar (Session UI + `questionnaire.md` header), instead of a 2-step arm/confirm click.

## [1.1.665] - 2026-02-24
### Fixed
- Standalone Project Manager (CEF): avoid crash when confirming ↻ Restart attempt in one-shot Description (replaced native `window.confirm` with a 2-step arm/confirm UX).

### Changed
- Session UI: ↻ Restart icon is now 1.6× larger.

## [1.1.664] - 2026-02-24
### Added
- One-shot Description: ↻ Restart attempt recovery to re-submit the questionnaire and start a fresh attempt when the original attempt hangs mid-turn.

## [1.1.663] - 2026-02-23
### Fixed
- Session UI: Stop (■) icon is now ~10% smaller for better visual balance.

## [1.1.662] - 2026-02-23
### Fixed
- Standalone Project Manager (CEF): after Stop (■), the next Enter/▶ now starts Core again via the Launcher bridge (instead of getting stuck with Core stopped).

## [1.1.661] - 2026-02-23
### Fixed
- Session UI: ■ now reliably stops Core by calling the shutdown endpoint (`POST /api/v1/shutdown`) and no longer leaves the “Agent is working…” placeholder visible after Stop.

## [1.1.660] - 2026-02-23
### Changed
- Session UI: the input Play/Stop button now stops Core on ■ (instead of a quick restart), then resumes on the next send (▶ / Enter starts Core and submits after reconnect).
- Session UI: refined the Stop icon visuals (larger ■, clearer red background, better vertical alignment).

## [1.1.659] - 2026-02-23
### Added
- Session UI: added a Play/Stop button next to the input (▶ sends like Enter; ■ restarts Core to abort the active turn and immediately unlock input for a new request).

## [1.1.658] - 2026-02-23
### Changed
- Session UI: locked input “please wait” placeholders now pulse opacity from 20% to 40% every 1000ms (provider color).

## [1.1.657] - 2026-02-23
### Changed
- Session UI: locked input “please wait” placeholders now pulse opacity from 5% to 50% every 1000ms (provider color).

## [1.1.656] - 2026-02-23
### Fixed
- Session UI: locked input “please wait” placeholders now actually pulse opacity from 5% to 80% every 500ms (provider color).

## [1.1.655] - 2026-02-23
### Changed
- Session UI: locked input “please wait” placeholders now pulse opacity from 5% to 80% every 500ms (provider color).

## [1.1.654] - 2026-02-23
### Changed
- Session UI: locked input “please wait” placeholders now use the provider wait color (matching the live turn timer) at 80% opacity.

## [1.1.653] - 2026-02-23
### Fixed
- Session timers: one-shot Description sessions (`resumeMode="no_resume"`) now show the live turn timer while running, without accumulating total time.

## [1.1.652] - 2026-02-22
### Changed
- Session timers: moved SSOT to Core and deliver via workspace snapshots so totals stay consistent across multi-workspace/multi-tab Project Manager usage and Project Manager reloads.

## [1.1.651] - 2026-02-22
### Changed
- Session UI: aligned footer `total:` label typography with timer digits (same font-size/family) for consistent visual weight.
- Session UI: aligned turn/total timers to a shared right anchor so upper and lower values are horizontally aligned.

## [1.1.650] - 2026-02-22
### Changed
- Session UI: total timer in footer is now static during lock/working state (always gray), then updates by jump when the turn completes; footer copy now shows `total:  00h 00m 00s`.
- Session UI: live turn timer in the input area is shown without background badge/pill (plain overlay text on the input field).

## [1.1.649] - 2026-02-22
### Fixed
- Session UI: task timers now match the contract semantics — total is always visible in the footer while input is locked; per-turn timer resets each new turn.
- Session UI: removed legacy manual force unlock toggle (no longer needed after continuity lock fixes).

### Changed
- Session UI: timer display format is now text-only `00h 00m 00s` (no flip animation).

## [1.1.648] - 2026-02-22
### Added
- Session UI: persistent task execution timer (HH:MM:SS) with 3D flip digits — shows live time while the agent is working and keeps an accumulated total per workflow-agent across continuity rollovers and Core restarts.

## [1.1.647] - 2026-02-22
### Fixed
- Project Manager / Session UI (BUG-2026-02-22-01): avoid stuck “resuming/blocked” on cold start — unlock input when `workspace:snapshot` reports `turnState=idle` and `continuityLockActive=false`, even if `continuityLockReason` is missing.
- Core / Workspace snapshots: normalize idle resume-in-place sessions to emit an explicit unlock hint `continuityLockReason="no_rollover_needed"` (defense-in-depth; reason is never a hard unlock gate).
- Crash/restart resilience: after Core restarts mid-turn, input unblocks automatically when the snapshot is `idle/unlocked`; sending “Continue” resumes the interrupted turn.

### Changed
- Docs: update release notes (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) before packaging.
- Note: `1.1.647` is a doc-synced rebuild of `1.1.646` artifacts (no additional code changes).

## [1.1.646] - 2026-02-22
### Fixed
- Project Manager / Session UI (BUG-2026-02-22-01): avoid stuck “resuming/blocked” on cold start — unlock input when `workspace:snapshot` reports `turnState=idle` and `continuityLockActive=false`, even if `continuityLockReason` is missing.
- Core / Workspace snapshots: normalize idle resume-in-place sessions to emit an explicit unlock hint `continuityLockReason="no_rollover_needed"` (defense-in-depth; reason is never a hard unlock gate).
- Crash/restart resilience: after Core restarts mid-turn, input unblocks automatically when the snapshot is `idle/unlocked`; sending “Continue” resumes the interrupted turn.

### Changed
- Release notes: `1.1.646` artifacts were packaged before the docs were updated; use `1.1.647` for the doc-synced release.

## [1.1.643] - 2026-02-21
### Fixed
- Claude / Recovery hints: corrected provider-home auth command in user-facing errors to `HOME=~/.codeai-hub/providers/claude/home claude /login`.

## [1.1.642] - 2026-02-20
### Changed
- Release maintenance rebuild: regenerated unified local artifacts (providers/core/UI/launcher) and VSIX for clean install validation.

## [1.1.641] - 2026-02-19
### Fixed
- Core / Codex Session Continuity: prevent duplicate rollover / double session separators when report generation is slow (no timeout-based retries; ignore rollover triggers from stale continuity segments).

## [1.1.640] - 2026-02-19
### Fixed
- Extension / UI: fix UI bundle installation (extract tarballs without an extra top-level folder) so VS Code Settings and Launcher UI can load from `~/.codeai-hub/packages/ui/*/current/*` without `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`.

## [1.1.639] - 2026-02-19
### Fixed
- UI / Sessions: show “resuming session…” placeholder during continuity rollover locks (avoid misleading “agent working” copy while switching/bootstraping a new workflow session).

## [1.1.638] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- UI / Sessions: show “resuming session…” placeholder during session binding (avoid misleading “agent working” copy while switching/hydrating a new workflow session).

## [1.1.637] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- Core / Templates: bundle and install `reviewer-template.md`, and pass its absolute path into Reviewer instructions (so the agent uses the template instead of searching for a missing file).

## [1.1.636] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- Claude / Session Continuity: compute context remaining % from the real `/context` snapshot (provider JSONL) and avoid incorrect rollovers caused by `modelUsage`/cache token totals.

## [1.1.635] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- Project Manager / Dialog sessions: prevent stuck-locked input by replaying the latest `workspace:snapshot` after dialog session hydration / rollover.

## [1.1.634] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- Core / Workspace snapshots: preserve session lock fields during partial updates (fixes missed unlock after continuity rollover).

## [1.1.626] - 2026-02-17
### Fixed
- Project Manager / Session UI: token usage now refreshes reliably after turns (including dialog sessions that hydrate snapshots after stream events).

## [1.1.625] - 2026-02-17
### Fixed
- Project Manager: auto-open the `Reviewer` dialog after live `Description → Reviewer` handoff (mirrors workflow tree click via `pm:dialog:open`).

## [1.1.624] - 2026-02-17
### Fixed
- Project Manager: fix live `Description → Reviewer` auto-handoff by resolving the reviewer runtime session deterministically (prevents hiding the reviewer before binding is ready).

## [1.1.623] - 2026-02-17
### Fixed
- Project Manager: live auto-handoff now focuses `Reviewer` session after one-shot `Description` completes (without manual click in workflow tree).
- Guardrail: reviewer auto-focus is scoped to `description/collector` transition to avoid stealing focus from unrelated active sessions.

## [1.1.622] - 2026-02-17
### Fixed
- Project Manager / Session UI: show a spinner in the left session area while a workflow session is being created (so the UI does not look frozen).

### Docs
- SolidWorks-Flow: archive non-contract drafts, clarify SSOT boundaries, and normalize doc statuses/metadata.
- Knowledge base: model selection/aliases are documented as SSOT-in-code (see `src/types/*-model-registry.ts`).

## Previous releases (summary)
Earlier releases in the `1.1.57x–1.1.62x` series focused on SSOT routing (dialog vs runtime), snapshot-first lock/usage authority, and continuity/resume reliability across providers. For the full history, use `git log` / tags.
