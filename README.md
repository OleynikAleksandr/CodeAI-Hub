# CodeAI Hub

CodeAI Hub is a Visual Studio Code extension that unifies multiple AI providers behind a single, type-safe experience. The project enforces strict quality and architecture rules through Ultracite, keeping the codebase ready for multi-agent orchestration.

## Current Release — v1.0.24
- **Todo focus toggle**: the Session TODO header now includes a drop-down control to collapse completed items and highlight only active work.
- **Unified session chrome typography**: TODO header, task rows, and Status Panel copy all share the same 11 px font, tightening the stack.
- **Release artifact**: packaged as `codeai-hub-1.0.24.vsix` via the release script.

## Features
- **React-driven command bar**: the extension view opens with a React-rendered quick-action row that mirrors the Claude Code Fusion UX.
- **Type-safe extension host**: webview messages are routed through facades and hooks with zero usage of `any`.
- **Quality gates out of the box**: architecture checks, duplication scanning, Ultracite linting, and TypeScript compilation run on every commit.
- **Scripted releases**: a single `scripts/build-release.sh` command bumps the version, builds the shell, validates the codebase, and packages a VSIX.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OleynikAleksandr/CodeAI-Hub.git
cd CodeAI-Hub
npm install
```

## Development Workflow
1. **Create or modify code** under `src/`. Keep files below 300 lines and prefer micro-classes plus facades.
2. **Run quality checks** before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run quality        # architecture check + Ultracite lint
   npm run check:tsprune  # optional: detect unused exports
   npm run compile        # ensure TypeScript output builds
   ```
3. **Commit**; pre-commit hooks re-run the same gates automatically.

## Building a Release
Always use the provided script to create a VSIX:
```bash
./scripts/build-release.sh <version>
```
The script performs:
- cache cleanup and version bump in `package.json`;
- optional webview UI build (if a bundled React app exists);
- architecture, duplication, lint, and type checks;
- VSIX packaging via `vsce`.

Artifacts such as `.claude`, `.vscode`, `doc/**`, and other local assets are excluded through `.vscodeignore`.
